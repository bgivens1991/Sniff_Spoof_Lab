# Sniff & Spoof Lab

Packet sniffing and spoofing are two important concepts in network security; they are two major threats
in network communication. Being able to understand these two threats is essential for understanding security measures in networking. There are many packet sniffing and spoofing tools, such as Wireshark,
Tcpdump, Netwox, Scapy, etc. Some of these tools are widely used by security experts, as well as by
attackers. Being able to use these tools is important for students, but what is more important for students in
a network security course is to understand how these tools work, i.e., how packet sniffing and spoofing are
implemented in software.
The objective of this lab is two-fold: learning to use the tools and understanding the technologies underlying these tools. For the second object, students will write simple sniffer and spoofing programs, and gain
an in-depth understanding of the technical aspects of these programs. This lab covers the following topics:
• Scapy
• Sniffing using the pcap library
• Raw socket

This is the code I used to sniff and spoof packets between two VMs from a another Attacker VM.  Also included is my report walkthrough the steps I did to executed these objectives.
